        <h2>Dataset Name: Power Cost Equalization (PCE) Data (Includes Uncleaned Years)</h2>
        <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
        <div><p style="color: red">Warning: This data set includes uncleaned data that is subject to major change during the cleaning process.</p>

The goal of Alaska Energy Authority's (AEA) Power Cost Equalization program is to provide economic assistance to customers in rural areas of Alaska where the kilowatt-hour charge for electricity can be considerably higher than the charge in more urban areas of the state. This dataset contains information reported monthly to AEA by participating utilities. Only data rows with the field cleaned_during_energy_statistics set to True were reviewed and cleaned for to meet AEDG data quality standards. Since some utilities may not report every month of the year, missing data are not uncommon.
