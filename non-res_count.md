### Source Files
  * Description: Contains estimated number of buildings for Alaskan communities. The data was acquired from a number of sources.  Actual building counts were collected either through tax assessor records or through an unrelated GIS project by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.  Using this data, a regression was done against the communities' median household incomes (from the 2010 Census) and the communities' populations. For those communities without an actual non-residential building count, the population and MHI was plugged into the equation to estimate the number of non-residential buildings.
