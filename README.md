# Alaska Affordable Energy Model Data
The Alaska Affordable Energy Model (AAEM) is a model designed by the [Alaska Energy Authority (AEA)](http://www.akenergyauthority.org) and built by the [University of Alaska Fairbanksâ€™ (UAF)](http://uaf.edu) [Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA)](http://gina.alaska.edu). The goal of the AAEM is to provide Alaska with a community energy model and project evaluation tool. It uses community and regional energy data, fuel data, and socio-economic data to:

- estimate and forecast heating and electricity consumption by sector,
- compare the ability of energy infrastructure project types (efficiency, renewable energy, fuel switching) to reduce the cost of energy in communities,
- determine the capital investment needed and the resulting energy savings to communities.


Disclaimer: The results presented in the model results are generated from available data on population, consumption, generation, and information on a technologies analyzed. For some communities this information may be incomplete. If you have, or know of a source of data that could help improve the model please contact The Alaska Energy Authority .
